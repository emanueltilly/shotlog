# ShotLog
**What is ShotLog?**<br>
This application is made for anyone who want a dedicated app for logging video clips and still image files during a photo-shoot, videoproduction or a fixture shootout.
The app keeps track of filenames, takes, notes, camera settings and so on.
With global exposure IDs ShotLog helps you keep still images and videoclips linked.

**Lighting fixture shootouts**<br>
ShotLog is tailor made for fixture shootouts. Features include Photometric data logging for LUX, CRI, Kelvin, Dimmer and Zoom-values, and support for bracketed still photography.

**CSV Export**<br>
While ShotLog is a great tool during produciton, the post production workflow might need something different. ShotLog can export the logs to CSV files for easy distribution between people and softwares.
